# Arduino_Morse_Code_Encoder_Decoder

*If you are unfamiliar with morse code and its uses, it is included in the presenation link in the end of this file.*

This project consists  of an arduino curcuit that decodes binary inputs (button presses) and incodes text into morse code light signals(Led pulses)

## Decoding mode: 
The decoding mode consists of the usage of three buttons respecitvely representing dots,dashes and end of characters. 

*Additionally there is another button that is responsible for changing the modes*

## Encoding mode: 
In encoding mode you can type text in the serial monitor and press Enter, Then it will be encoded and represented in morse code as light pulses.
